# Resources

[Backstretch jQuery Plugin](http://www.jquery-backstretch.com/ "Backstretch")

This plugin allowed me to set a background image to my resume site's landing section. While it will set the background image to the body tag by default, I have adjusted the code to target my landing class. The page can be resized, and the image will automatically adjust itself, similar to `background-image-size: cover;`.

[Owl Carousel 2](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/ "Owl Carousel 2")

This is another jQuery plugin. This particular plugin allowed me to create a responsive carousel slider that users can click and drag through. It automatically stops so there are always three images shown at a time. Once I have more time to spend working with the plugin, I plan to play with the settings mentioned on the plugin's site.

[St. Petersburg, FL Image](https://www.bankogaragedoors.com/locations/pinellas-county/st-petersburg/ "Banko Garage Doors")

I used this site for an image it has of St. Petersburg, FL, which is where I grew up. It's an iconic view of downtown St. Pete from the top of the pier.

# Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments

I just wanted to identify in this file that my custom JavaScript allows you to click on the h3 headings in my resume section and change the color from teal to red.
